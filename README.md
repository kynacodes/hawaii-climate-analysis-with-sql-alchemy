# hawaii-climate-analysis-with-sql-alchemy

Usage:
------------------
This data analysis uses Python and SQL Alchemy to analyze the climate of Hawaii in anticipation of an 
upcoming trip. It analyzes precipitation and the activity level of the observation stations. A Flask API
was then designed to create routes for the precipitation and station data.
